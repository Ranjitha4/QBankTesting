1. Introduction
I have put this test plan together to explain how we’re going to approach testing the login page on https://qbank.accelq.com/ 
It's a simple but crucial part of the application, and we need to make sure it's working flawlessly for all users.

2. Test Objectives

Make sure that users can log in with valid credentials.
Ensure the system prevents login with incorrect usernames or passwords.
Check that users see a clear error message when something goes wrong.
Test the login UI and check if everything looks good on desktop and mobile.

3. Scope

What we will test:

Logging in with valid credentials.
Logging in with invalid credentials (wrong username/password).
What happens if a user leaves the username or password blank.
Error messages for invalid inputs.
Ensuring passwords are hidden as they should be.
Simple security checks, like trying to break in with an SQL injection.

What we won’t test:

Backend/database logic.
Anything not directly related to logging in.

4. Test Approach
We will be doing manual testing, which means we will actually go through the login process step-by-step. 
We will test how the form behaves when we enter valid and invalid data. 
Also, we’ll be testing the UI to see if it looks good on both desktop and mobile versions.
